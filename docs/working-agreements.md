Channels: Our decisions will be made in Microsoft Teams.

Response Times: We will try to respond within 24 hours.

Meeting Etiquette: We will meet either in virtual meetings or in person after class.

PR Tone: We will try to make our comments as constructive as possible while also being respectful. 

Design Improvements:
- Add dropdown menu with different major muscle groups with exercise suggestions
- Add progresssion logs of yourself (uploading pictures)
- Keyboards overlap with interactable content -> make the content pop up so the user could interact with it
